*if is used to checked some conditions in order to execute or to run something
*for the check we have some Relation operator used in c such as
>     greater than              5 > 4 is TRUE
<     less than                 4 < 5 is TRUE
>=    greater than or equal     4 >= 4 is TRUE
<=    less than or equal        3 <= 4 is TRUE
==    equal to                  5 == 5 is TRUE
!=    not equal to  

*sometimes if the condition is not true we need to execute some others differents actions based to other conditions 
we use else if and by default if any of those conditions is true we need to execute default contition it is used with else


*for more conditions we use boolean operator or logical operator as AND (&&) , OR (||), !

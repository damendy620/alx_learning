    <h4  style="background-color: blue;">concept i learn about the concept</h4>
    <h5> Accordind to Angela Lee Duckworth spech</h5>
    <p>grit is patient and perseverence for a very long term for goals</p>
    <p>grit is sticking with your future day in day out not for the week not for the month 
     but for years works very hard to make that goal reality
    </p>
    <p> grit is living life like it's a marrathon not a sprint</p>

    <h6> growth mindset</h6>
    <p>so far the best idea she heard about building grit in kids is something calls growth mindset</p>
    <p>growth mindset is an idea developpe at stanford university by carol dweck</p>
    <p>the growth mindset is the ability to learn is not fixe it can change with your effort</p>
    <p>carol dweck show that much more kids learn about the mind and the capability to change the are more perseverence
        when they fallier is not a permanent condition
    </p>
    <p>we need to take our best idea our best intuition and we need to test them to measure where we
        success we could will to to be wrong to take the lesson we have learn and undestand more
    </p>

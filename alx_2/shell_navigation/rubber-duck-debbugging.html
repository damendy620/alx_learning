        1/obtain a rubber duck(bathtub variety)
        2/ place rubber duck on desk and inform it you are just going to go over some code with it, if that's all right
        3/ Explain to the duck what your code is supposed to do, and then go into detail and explain your code line by line
        4/ At some point you will tell the duck what you are doing next and the raliqe that that is not in fact whatyou are actually doing.
        The duck will sit serently, happy in the knowledge that it has helped you on your way
        5/ works every time. Actually, if you don't have a rubber duck you could ...ask a fellow programmer or an engineer to sit in
